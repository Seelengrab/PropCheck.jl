"""
    shrink(x)

Function to be used during shrinking of `x`. Returns an iterable of shrunk values.

Must _never_ return a previously input value, i.e. no value `x` used as input should ever be produced by `shrink(x)` or subsequent applications of `shrink` on the produced elements. This _will_ lead to infinite looping during shrinking.
